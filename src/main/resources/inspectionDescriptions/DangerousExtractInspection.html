This inspection checks for a dangerous call to the <code>extract()</code> function.
This function allows extracting an <code>array</code> where the keys represent the variable names to be extracted.
If an extraction occurs without proper validation, a malicious actor could modify variables and alter the expected behavior of the
application.<br/><br/>

<strong>Consider the following code:</strong>

<pre><code>$isAdministrator = $user->isAdministrator(); // A true check.
extract(Request::post()); // You shouldn't be doing this...</code></pre>

In the above case, if <code>Request::post()</code> contains something like <code>[ "isAdministrator" => true ]</code>,
the previous variable will be overwritten with the value <code>true</code>.<br/><br/>

To protect against this, you can use the second parameter <code>EXTR_SKIP</code>,
which allows variables to be created only if they don't already exist.
Alternatively, you can keep using explicitly <code>EXTR_OVERWRITE</code>,
which is the default, but only when you are certain about what you're doing.
