    This inspection helps normalize the format of increment and decrement unary expressions (<code>$a++</code> and <code>$a--</code>, respectively),
    allowing you to decide which side the operator should be present on.<br/><br/>

    However, not every unary expression can be modified,
    so this inspection only acts under safe conditions.
