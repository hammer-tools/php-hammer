This inspection helps normalize the format of increment and decrement unary expressions (<code>$a++</code> and <code>$a--</code>,
respectively),
allowing you to decide which side the operator should be present on.<br/><br/>

However, not every unary expression can be modified,
so this inspection only acts under safe conditions.
