This inspection identifies the use of backslashes (e.g., <code>dir\file.php</code>) in file system-related functions,
including the <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> expressions.<br/><br/>

Backslashes are only allowed in Windows. When running the file on a Unix server, for example,
you are likely to encounter serious problems.
