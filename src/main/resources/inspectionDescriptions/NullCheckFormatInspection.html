        This inspection helps normalize the format of the null check.
        You can choose to use the <code>is_null()</code> function or the <code>===</code> comparison.<br/><br/>

        Even though <code>is_null()</code> is a function, PHP has enough optimization that the cost is exactly the same as a comparison.
        So just pay attention to the code style. There are no gains or losses here beyond that.
