        This inspection checks the use of the <strong>error control operator</strong>,
        also known as the <strong>at-operator</strong> (<code>@</code>), which allows you to suppress
        errors that may occur during the execution of a function.<br/><br/>

        However, its use is not recommended since important errors can be suppressed and
        modify the expected behavior of the application.<br/><br/>

        Only use this operator at specific points, such as to avoid a race condition using functions like <code>mkdir()</code>.
