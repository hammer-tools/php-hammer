    This inspection ensures that an overridden method is calling its parent method,
    guaranteeing that the class will maintain the behavior declared by the parent method.<br/><br/>

    By default, this inspection will occur even if you have explicitly added the <code>#[Override]</code> attribute to the method,
    but you can disable this option. If you do so, methods with this attribute will not require calls to the method defined in the parent.
