        Using the <code>compact()</code> function can cause a bug in PHP
        (<a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78970">#78970</a>)
        where the expected variable cannot be imported automatically.<br /><br />

        In this case, the suggestion is to avoid using this function inside short functions
        until this problem is resolved.
