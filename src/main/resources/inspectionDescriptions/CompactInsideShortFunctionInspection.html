Using the <code>compact()</code> function can cause a bug in PHP
(<a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78970">#78970</a>)
where the expected variable cannot be imported automatically.<br/><br/>

In this case, the suggestion is to avoid using this function inside short functions
until this problem is resolved.
