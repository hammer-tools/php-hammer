This inspection checks if potentially sensitive parameters are protected by the <code>#[SensitiveParameter]</code> attribute.
Protecting parameters in this way ensures that in logs or debugging,
sensitive information such as passwords or bank codes is replaced with a placeholder value.<br/><br/>

This feature will be available in PHP 8.2+ projects.<br/><br/>

You can include or exclude other names in the options, in addition to the default ones.
