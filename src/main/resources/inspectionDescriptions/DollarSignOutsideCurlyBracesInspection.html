This inspection checks the usage of the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) outside of the curly braces on strings,
which is deprecated as of PHP 8.2.<br/><br/>

<strong>Important:</strong> Using the dollar sign <strong>inside</strong> curly braces is still allowed (e.g., <code>"{$x}"</code>),
but using it <strong>outside</strong> (e.g., <code>"${x}"</code>) is no longer allowed.<br/><br/>

The difference in usage is subtle, so this inspection can help you avoid this type of problem.
