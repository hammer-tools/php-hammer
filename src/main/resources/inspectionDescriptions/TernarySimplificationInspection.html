        This inspection analyzes the possibility of simplifying ternary operators with identical or non-identical comparisons.<br/><br/>

        For example, the code <code>$x === $y ? $y : $x</code> can be simplified to just <code>$x</code>,
        since if the comparison is <code>true</code>, it means that the true side is the value being compared (<code>$y</code>).
        And since the false side returns the expression itself as well,
        then the ternary operator is unnecessary since the result will always be the expression itself.<br/><br/>

        <strong>Example:</strong>

        <pre><code>return $x === 123 ? 123 : $x;

// If $x is 123, then return 123 (the value of $x itself);
// If $x is not 123, then return the value of $x itself;
// Therefore, the value of $x itself is always returned.</code></pre>
